SCUM TODO

1) reconnect faster

2) off line mode - some delay

--> Case: when there is a connection to the wifi but there is no master sending a message 
	- should not matter too much since router is at the sound bike

3) set maters sensitivty paramaters


--> osc support for master and slave
----------> Slave
	/val - animation value
	/mode - color program to run
----------> Master
	/paramaters
		/sensitivity
		

----------

-> Loose wifi connection and start programed animation , kill router	- 8 seconds
-> Start wifi router and wait for master, router start and connect 	- 30 seconds
